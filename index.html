            Education studies encompasses various subfields like pedagogy,
            comparative education, and the philosophy, psychology, sociology,
            economics, and history of education.[133] The philosophy of
            education is the branch of applied philosophy that examines many of
            the basic assumptions underlying the theory and practice of
            education. It studies education both as a process and as a
            discipline while trying to provide exact definitions of its nature
            and how it differs from other phenomena. It further examines the
            purpose of education, its different types, and how to conceptualize
            teachers, students, and their relation.[134] It includes educational
            ethics, which investigates the moral implications of education; for
            example, what ethical principles direct it and how teachers should
            apply them to specific cases. The philosophy of education has a long
            history and was discussed

          Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character
          traits and comes in many forms. Formal education happens in a complex
          institutional framework, like public schools. Non-formal education is
          also structured but takes place outside the formal schooling system,
          while informal education is unstructured learning through daily
          experiences. Formal and non-formal education are divided into levels
          that include early childhood education, primary education, secondary
          education, and tertiary education. Other classifications focus on the
          teaching method, like teacher-centered and student-centered education,
          and on the subject, like science education, language education, and
          physical education. The term "education" can also refer to the mental
          states and qualities of educated people and the academic field
          studying educational phenomena.

        <p class="sectionSubTag smallText">
          Education in India is primarily managed by the state-run public
          education system, which falls under the command of the government at
          three levels: central, state and local. Under various articles of the
          Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory
          Education Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a
          fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio of
          the total number of public schools to private schools in India is
          10:3.[7] Education in India covers different levels and types of
          learning, such as early childhood education, primary education,
          secondary education, higher education, and vocational education. It
          varies significantly according to different factors, such as location
          (urban or rural), gender, caste, religion, language, and disability.
